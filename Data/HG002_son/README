#Dataset
- Individual : HG002 (NA24385)
- PacBio_reads_set.fastq.gz : this file is a set of PacBio reads provided by GiaB consortium (PacBio Mt Sinai NIST, ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/PacBio_MtSinai_NIST/).
- reference_at_breakpoints.fasta : this file is the reference of the allele sequences, obtained after running 1st SVJedi module on the GRCh37.p13 reference genome.
- HG002_20SVs_Tier1_v0.6_PASS.vcf : this VCF file is a subsample of 20 genotyped SV from the v0.6 SV benchmark set, described in Zook et al. "A robust benchmark for germline structural variant detection." BioRxiv (2019): 664623 (ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/analysis/NIST_SVs_Integration_v0.6/HG002_SVs_Tier1_v0.6.vcf.gz). This set contains 10 insertions and 10 deletions.


#To run SVJedi on this dataset
python3 ../../svjedi.py -v HG002_20SVs_Tier1_v0.6_PASS.vcf -a reference_at_breakpoints.fasta -i PacBio_reads_set.fastq.gz

#Genotype results are obtained in genotype_results.vcf file. Expected genotype results are given in expected_genotype_results.vcf file.
